# Add GIFs in your message

Search and add GIFs in your message.

First, [open the compose box](/help/open-the-compose-box). Then

* **Click the GIPHY logo** at the bottom of the compose box. This opens
a popover containing the trending GIFs right now according to GIPHY.
* (optional) Use the search box to get GIFs related to your search.
* **Click on the GIF** to insert a link to the GIF in the compose box.


Zulip will automatically generate a **thumbnail** of the GIF when you send
it. You can
[preview the message](/help/preview-your-message-before-sending) before
sending to see what the GIF will look like.

## Troubleshooting info

* If you don't see the GIPHY icon or if you see an error in the GIFHY popover,
your API key maybe incorrect. Please contact your administrator to check if
the GIPHY API key is correct or follow instructions
[here](https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/production/giphy-gif-integration.html) to enable the integration.

* If your GIFs only appear as links after sending them, check if
[**Show previews of uploaded and linked images**](/help/allow-image-link-previews)
option is checked.
